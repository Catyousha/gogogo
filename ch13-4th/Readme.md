new things learned from each project:
* add-int & reverse
    * Exercise 3: Fix the AddInt() function from fuzz/code.go.
    * test code vulnerability / runtime err detection with various input generated by fuzzy testing
    * fuzzy testing is setup with `testing.F` param
    * seed inputs for fuzz tests using `f.Add()`
    * run fuzzy test with `-fuzz=FuncName` flag
        * add `-fuzztime 10s` to limit fuzzy test time
